# SVM_using_CVX_in_MATLAB
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using the powerful CVX optimization framework in MATLAB.
SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks, while CVX is a user-friendly tool for specifying and solving convex optimization problems.
